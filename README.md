Deep Learning-based Brain Tumor MRI Classification using PyTorch.
# Brain Tumor MRI Classification using Deep Learning

This project classifies brain MRI images into **Tumor** and **No Tumor** using PyTorch deep learning models.

## Dataset

The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection) and is **not included** due to size and licensing. You can download it and place it in a folder named `archive` in your working directory to run the notebook.

## Models Trained

✅ Simple CNN  
✅ Custom CNN  
✅ MobileNetV2 (Transfer Learning)  
✅ ResNet18 (Transfer Learning)

## Results (10 Epochs)

| Model       | Accuracy |
|-------------|----------|
| Simple CNN  | 80%      |
| Custom CNN  | 80%      |
| MobileNetV2 | 88%      |
| ResNet18    | 94%      |
